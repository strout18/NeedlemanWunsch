Created using Jupyter Notebooks and Python by Stella Trout.

This repository includes two implementations in Python of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, perhaps most commonly used for aligning DNA/RNA sequences. The one titled 'LESS_EFFICIENT' is my first implementation, which takes much more RAM than the second one, which was written second. These were intended to be part of an implementation of Hirschberg's algorithm, (see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirschberg%27s_algorithm) which was not completed.
